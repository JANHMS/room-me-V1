# Room Me
### Idea
This is a smart up idea, which eases the process of finding roommates.
I am moving often places and often I find it quite exhausing to find the space I like and also the roommates, that we vibe together with. 
Therefore I wanted to implement something similar to bumble, but instead for dates of for friends for roommates. 

## User Experience
In this first version:
1. A user authenticates via an phone application.
2. A user has to answer specific questions regarding their interests. 
2.1 These answers are then stored to the DB (Firebase).
3. The user enters the application dashboard.
4. The user sees all the potential houses in his desired city (e.g. Paris).
5. The user sees scores from 1/10 about how much he and the other person overlap in interests (e.g. 7/10).
6. User clicks on the house and can see pictures.
7. FInds it interesting -> Send a message and get into contact. Integrated chatting system.

This has been developed until a certain point. However I realized that there are already other solutions out there and due to time and resource constrait I archived this idea. However I think it was a good project to learn a lot and also a potential good application, which could provide use to many users. 


## Technical Aspects
* I used IONIC, which is a framework to develop JS Applications, which can be used by Android and IOS systems. I thought this might be good, because the more people I could reach the better. 
* The DB is Firebase, which is pretty simple for JS Applications and fast to set up.
